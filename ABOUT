Accomplish 

- Switch whenever it goes from LOW to HIGH The led will toggle
- When the switch is pressed sends "pressed" to the serial monitr
- When the led toggles it sends its state to the serial monitor
- Sends continuous serial data comes from temperature sensor each 3 second rate  

Design

When interrupt comes from the switch on rising edge and it waits 200 ms " a time to be sure there is no noise" it toggles the LED and sends "PRESSED" to the serial monitor it also prints the state of the LED.
At the same time it waits each 3 secounds to read from the temprature sensor and pints the value in celsius


What I learned from the task

- How Interrupts work in arduino
- How to work with a temprature sensor and converting the input to celsius 

Experiance with arduino

I have worked with arduino in RC Car project before
